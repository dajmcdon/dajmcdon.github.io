    "text": "Course description\nLargely unnoticed by economists, over the last three decades statisticians and computer scientists have developed sophisticated prediction procedures and methods of model selection and forecast evaluation under the rubric of statistical learning theory. These methods have revolutionized pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, and the modern industry of data mining (without the pejorative connotation) would not exist without it.\nIn this short course, we will investigate the connections between modern statistical methodology and standard techniques which are more common in economics and social science. The goal is to develop an understanding for the circumstances under which different statistical methods are appropriate, how methods behave when the model for the data generating process is incorrect, and why some methods can adapt while others cannot. We will focus especially on selecting models with good predictive performance and on the relationships between model complexity, statistical estimation, and the amount of data used to estimate the model.\nThe starting point for statistical learning is the notion of predictive risk and the tradeoff between bias and variance. With this tradeoff in mind, we will investigate the importance of assessing models using training and test data, the benefits of regularization, and the necessity of selecting tuning parameters carefully. We will illustrate each of these issues with some standard econometric procedures applied to financial and economic datasets while at the same time, introducing some potentially new procedures which may be useful in your own research."

Also, remind yourself what a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is (you probably know more about this than we do, but perhaps not). Less useful are GMM techniques and cointegration.\nBefore coming to class, we suggest that you take a look at the first three (3) chapters of Cosma Shalizi’s preprint Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View. These chapters will serve as a nice introduction to the materials we intend to cover. The rest of the book is great too if you are feeling more ambitious/motivated."

Divide papers into sections: published, papers under review, papers in progress. Put anything that exists as a document and that you can talk about for 2 minutes in one of these categories. But for it to be here, it should actually be a paper (preferably linked and on arXiv or bioRxiv or similar).\nAnd be absolutely certain that you can articulate the main points, contributions, and difficulties for every paper you list.\nYou can get an interview with a few publications. You may not get an interview if you have many publications. If you have no publications, it is very unlikely that you will be competitive. That’s just the current market unfortunately.

And that you, as a privileged faculty member in the ivory tower, are going to take meaningful action to address it in some way. There are all sorts of ways to describe and motivate the statement. I tend to look for concrete actions more than anything else. If you advocated for another female student who was not being treated fairly by a male professor, this is a place to describe that. Sometimes people use this to describe how they personally are from a diverse background. That can be important to discuss, especially as it speaks to how you would interact with students and colleagues and help to protect others from undergoing treatment that you experienced.\nI have often read grant applications and other documents where applicants (senior people) try to quantify their contributions with statements like “my lab currently has 3 women and 4 students from underprivileged backgrounds”. This is NOT diversity, and for me is uncomfortably close to empty statements like “I’m can’t be against XXX. I have a friend who’s XXX.” Avoid making statements like that.\nThere are many ways to think about this statement. And there are probably lots of resources online. But, if you have some time, it’s worth reading Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist”. The book is written mainly about race, but the lessons are broadly applicable and important."

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nEvery member of every search committee views these documents differently. Indiana University would pay for 2–3 flyouts. UBC brings more like 6 candidates. We typically make cuts in a few stages: (1) remove all those not suited (50% reduction); (2) each member ranks the remainder from 1–3; (3) keep all candidates ranked 3 by any member; (4) cut down to 6–10 candidates to give phone interviews.\nSure ways to get cut in stage 1 include having incomplete applications and having a CV produced in Microsoft Word with coloured highlights or otherwise looking non-academic. Unfortunately, the first cut is almost always based entirely on the CV. Getting to stage 4 is the hard part, and often based on some amount of luck. It is also very difficult for us to do. We usually have more than 30 candidates who all look like plausible hires that we would want. At this point, we’re looking for (a) really strong research record; (b) really strong letters of recommendation; (c) evidence of teaching strength; and/or (d) reasons to believe that you want to come here. Any of these can get you to the phone interview, but (c) and (d) are more important than you might expect. Like it or not, you WILL have to teach undergraduates, so if it looks like you’ll be a disaster, you’re out. Trying to infer this is difficult, and often depends more on your listed teaching experience and your letters of recommendation than on your teaching statement. As for (d), we look at where you’re from, if someone has met you, and what you say in your cover letter. This is the place where generic applications hurt.\nI just want to emphasize that last point again. Making a strong case in a cover letter why “this place” is for you can really help. We know that the first offer we make is not the only offer that this person will receive. So if you have strong reasons, that can make a difference, especially at the cut-to-interview stage. We’d rather bring candidate 7 who says they really want to come than candidate 6 who had a completely generic application, if everything else is close.\nAs for the research record, we are looking for evidence that you can do research on your own. This is not the same as a long list of published work. A long list of published work with the same co-author (advisor) all the time makes us nervous. Having one publication in JASA or Annals or JMLR and nothing else listed as in progress similarly makes us nervous. We want to know that you can do work away from your advisor and have things that will be ready to be submitted in the next few years. We often have post-docs who are hard to evaluate because they have 2 good publications with their dissertation advisor and 2 more with their post-doc advisor, but we know that the advisors invented these areas of research. This makes us wonder whether the person can come up with their own topics. This is another place that letters are important."

    "text": "Zoom / phone interviews\nThese may or may not occur prior to an in-person interview. They generally last 30 minutes to an hour. You will be on the phone with a few members of the search committee. Sometimes they will have a standard list of questions to ask you. Here are a few samples.\n\nWhy did you apply to our university?\nAre there any faculty whose research particularly interests you?\nWhat are some of the courses listed on our website you might want to teach?\nWhat is your philosophy about research? Do you like theory? Applications? Combination?\nWhat is the motivation for your thesis research?\n\nSometimes the questions will reference your website or other information that is available about you online or in your collection of documents.\nThere will generally be time at the end for you to ask questions. It is very important that you ask some. Ask things that show that you have thought about the university and want to go visit. Some samples.\n\nHow many courses will I be asked to teach and what types?\nWhere do you see the department going in the future?\nWhen will I hear about being invited for an interview?\nI saw that XXX is interested in XXX, blah blah blah?\n\nI personally find these incredibly helpful. There is almost always a top candidate who bombs out, while another takes a big leap. We are looking to see what you know about the department and to discern whether you want to be here and if you can speak in front of people. We always have a prepared list of questions. Last year, we started by asking a question about the advertisement we posted. We always ask what kinds of classes you want to teach. Don’t answer “anything”. It’s much better if you can say, “I looked at your website, and I’m really interested in teaching X and Y.” In our case, new hires typically teach a graduate-level course in an area of their choosing as well as one of the standard undergrad courses. It’s better if you say “I want to teach your S3XX course” than “I want to teach RKHS to the undergraduates.”\nBefore the phone call, read over everything that you can about the department. The website, each faculty member’s research area, the official ad, information about the city, etc. This is good advice for any interview (university or private-sector)."

    "section": "Flyouts",
    "text": "Flyouts\nInterviews are fun but long. A standard flyout begins at 9am and lasts until 4 or 5pm with a 50 minute talk somewhere in the middle. Usually there is dinner either the night before, the night of, or both. That said, it is not nearly as stressful as it would seem. People just want to get to know you. It is as much about them convincing you to go there as it is about you convincing them you’re hot stuff.\nFrom the moment something is scheduled for you, be on your best behavior. Be nice to the driver from the airport, the people at the front desk of the hotel, and the department secretaries. Any or none of these people could potentially have some small input into a hiring decision. By the same token, don’t dress like a slob at any point (even on the plane). Wear clothing you would be comfortable in if you wanted to impress someone. Nice jeans and a nice shirt is fine. In fact, this same outfit may be fine for the actual interview.\nIn general, statistics departments are not very formal. Business casual is usually fine. This means slacks and a button down shirt for men or women, perhaps a skirt, a vest or sweater over top, etc. You may even be able to wear nice, dark coloured jeans without rips or worn marks. Sometimes a tie is nice, but not really necessary. Think of what a well dressed professor in your department might wear. For business schools or industry, wear a suit unless told otherwise. That said, shave, cut your hair, try to look like someone who tried instead of someone who has given up on life. Make sure your clothes fit, etc.\nThere may be some walking involved, and interviews often take place in the winter. Bring things to be comfortable with the temperature and weather.\nThere are a few items that you should make sure to have. Use a backpack. Unless you go to a business school or a finance company, then get a briefcase.\n\nPen and paper\nList of questions to ask\nLaptop with your talk, and whatever is necessary to make it project\nUSB key with your talk on it. Or put it online. Or both. You may need to use a machine that’s not yours.\nA bottle of water (you are going to talk for the next 8-10 hours and your mouth will get very dry)\nChapstick and other personal hygiene items you don’t want to be without\n$20 cash in smallish bills. You may need to tip a driver or a bellhop or something.\n\nYou will generally meet with a bunch of people for 30 minutes to 1 hour each. You will likely meet a Dean and the Department head. The Dean may know nothing about you. He/she may need the 30 second version of your research.\nThis time, be prepared to ask lots of questions. You can (and should) repeat these to everyone you meet. It hurts nothing to ask 3 people the same question. Ask anything that is important to you. If you like playing sports, ask about sports. Whatever. Some of these are probably better suited to asking your dinner / lunch host(s). If you have a two-body problem, avoid questions relating to your significant other unless this information is already open (see below). These are better handled during the negotiation, once they offer you the job, or perhaps in your meeting with the Head. They (legally) cannot ask about such things unless you bring it up. Don’t ask what the salary is. This is a bit more delicate, and you want to know, but this is actually somewhat standard. More below.\n\nFor anyone\n\nWhat do you like about the department?\nWhat do you dislike about the department?\nHow is the department socially?\nHow are the students?\nHow are the graduate students supported?\nWhat is the expectation about grants?\nTenure?\nWhere are the good places to live? (This shows you want to come here)\nHow are the public schools? (again)\nDo you get graders/TAs?\n\nFor the department head\n\nWhat is the startup package?\nWill I get summer support?\nComputing support?\nTravel support? (These last three are the usual startup package)\nHow do Stats Journals vs Discipline journals play in the tenure decision?\nHow does teaching/research/service balance in the tenure decision?\nAre there intermediate reviews?\nTeaching releases?\nHow much service will I do in the first few years?\n\nFor the Dean\n\nCost of living\nHow does the department fit in the school? The university?\nUniversity/School level funding opportunities?\n\n\nAgain, they want to get to know you. It is doubtful that you will get tricky research questions at any point (even really during your talk). It’s not a quiz. Just relax and have fun. Use all the time you have. There were interviews where I filled the whole time with my own questions and they asked me nothing. This is probably not ideal, but sometimes you get someone who really likes to talk.\nTalking about spousal issues is tricky. In some cases, you actually want to mention it to the Head now (you may even want to do it when you’re offered the fly-out). Some universities are good at making spousal accommodations and, the more time they have to do it, the more likely it is that they can find something that your spouse will like. This may not be the case at all places though. Getting an offer usually comes with a 2–week timeline. Waiting until the offer to try to get a spousal hire then means sending in an entire application and hoping another department can review it and bring out the person in a very short amount of time. If we know when you fly out (or when we offer you the fly out), we can start the process immediately. That said, other places may not be as pro-active as we are.\nMy personal view is, if they discriminate against you for a spouse or kids, you don’t want to be there. It is (in my opinion) very unlikely for family issues to lead to a candidate not getting an offer. But some places may not be willing to get your partner the type of position they want. This is something you should think about carefully as soon as you get an offer for an interview. Ask your advisor or others if they know the department / university. Have a plan with your significant other for how to handle this situation. Talk about this early, probably when you’re sending out applications."

    "section": "Salary",
    "text": "Salary\nLook at the ASA salary survey. The department head making the offer probably has. In 2011 (yes, ages ago, but I haven’t checked recently), the median salary for a first year Assistant Professor at a US research university was $80,000. The median at a teaching university was about $60,000. This is likely where the offer will be. The goal should be the 3rd quartile which wass about $5000 more in each case. You’re qualified, and they want you. So you should shoot for that.\nYou may not get it. Salary can be either flexible or inflexible. It is often constrained by the person who got the job last year. The department head will have a hard time giving you more money than that person. There are sometimes other considerations as well like taxes. Some places have no income tax, so they pay you less. The 90th percentile is nice, but it’s for New York, San Francisco, Texas, and business schools. If you’re not there, you’re not going to get it. Also, in the US, these are usually 9 month contracts. You should think of your actual salary as 11/9 of the 9 month salary because you can get (usually) 2 months of summer support through grants and startup. The amount of extra will be in your contract. In Canada, it’s a 12 month contract, and you cannot pay yourself extra with grant money. Labour laws are different here."

    "href": "other/market-advice.html#startup-package",
    "title": "Advice for the academic job market",
    "section": "Startup package",
    "text": "Startup package\nThis is generally where there is a lot of freedom to make the offer more competitive. The startup package may have 6 components, all of which are negotiable: (1) teaching releases, (2) summer support, (3) research/travel funding, (4) graduate assistant support, (5) moving expenses, and (6) computing resources.\nTeaching releases are potentially difficult to negotiate, but you should be able to get 2–3 classes off prior to tenure depending on the teaching load. Most research universities have 2+1 loads, meaning 2 classes one semester and 1 the other. If the load is less, you will get fewer releases. If it is 2+2, you should get more like 4 releases. To get it: you need this time at the beginning to get settled without teaching too much. You will likely need it in year 3 to apply for grants and prepare for the interim review. Don’t underestimate how important teaching leave is. It can make your life much more managable. Teaching will suck up more time than you think.\nSummer support is one of the easiest things to ask for, and it is potentially a lot of money. You should get anywhere from 2–4 months of support. If 4, it will be over the first two years. The reasons for summer support are to aid with course prep, to collaborate with people from your previous institutions, to write grants to get future summer support, and to finish up papers left over from grad school.\nResearch and travel funding is another easy thing to get, because, like summer support, it is a transitory expense. Salary increases cause lots of issues. You should be able to get $50,000–$250,000 spread over the first 3 years. This is to buy text books and to go to conferences. It may be to buy computers or software, though basic computing (along with office equipment) is generally separate. You want to go to conferences so that you can say nice things about your university and become a hotshot. This is an advertising budget.\nIf it’s at the high end, it may also include RA support or post-docs. Sometimes the summer salary is rolled into this. Sometimes you cannot pay yourself out of this budget. Ask.\nSome places may offer you a graduate assistant (or it’s part of the money above). This is probably more useful if you do more applied work. You may not get to choose the assistant, and more senior faculty will often claim the best students. In the US, for my first job, I didn’t see this as crucial. On the other hand, I know someone who successfully negotiated for a post doc for 2 years, so if this is something that is important to you, go for it. In Canada, RA support is more important.5\nMoving expenses are variable but seem to be at least $3000 up to around $7000 unless you are moving pretty far. Many of the places that I have heard of actually have this mandated by the government, so it’s fixed. But it’s still worth asking about.\nMost places will give you a “standard” computer and printer, whatever that means. If you need serious computing resources regularly, you can ask for a more serious computer. Most places will have a computer guru and a cluster that you can use. So for most people, this is probably less of an issue. On the other hand, you may want an office computer and a laptop. So you can ask for that. But they may say to buy it with your research / travel money.\nThe salary is hard to negotiate, and different universities do this differently. In some places, you ask the department head for something and they go to the dean. In others, you negotiate with the head or chair, and in others, with the dean. My experience is that the salary is basically fixed without a counter offer from a similar institution. And often, fixed even then. Sometimes our department tries to hire people who got MUCH stronger offers from other departments, but these departments were often in MUCH more expensive locations. Deans know this and won’t budge. You should spend some time honestly comparing the cost of living. Don’t just accept an offer that’s 25% higher. Likely the COL is 50% more."

    "section": "Report",
    "text": "Report\nThe report should have the following structure:1\n\nSummary (~3 pages): The first section of the report should provide a summary of the paper and the problem(s) it addresses, including its relationship to any previous work, its major contributions (e.g., novel techniques, algorithmic developments, problem formulations, theoretical contributions), and any limitations or shortcomings (e.g., restrictive assumptions, computational constraints, flawed methodology). The aim of this section is for you to synthesize the findings of a body of work and clearly present the important points.\nMini-proposals for research projects Each proposal should describe a research project that applies, extends, generalizes, adapts, or addresses shortcomings of the QP. Seemingly unrelated ideas inspired by the original QP are also fine. You may write more than one proposal, but you must write at least one. A proposal should concisely describe: the primary problem to be addressed; an approach (or multiple approaches) for addressing the problem; any technical or conceptual sub-problems; the potential impact of the project. You are not expected to pursue any of these projects (though we can talk more if you would like to). The aim of this section is to get you thinking creatively about research, and to begin developing the skills necessary for writing research proposals. Each proposal should be no more than 2 pages max.\nQP specific project results Each potential QP listed below has a brief description of a related project. We will discuss the project in detail in our initial meeting, and we can meet again (as many times as necessary) before the report due date. Your grade will not be affected by how good the results look, whether your approach improves on past work, or whether you achieve the initial goal of the project. I will use this project to evaluate your research potential, which includes (among other aspects):\n\nclearly formulating a research question;\nsetting up a useful mathematical framework for the problem;\nthinking creatively and independently to develop a solution;\nrelating the problem to existing work, in other fields if necessary;\nbeing resourceful and asking questions when necessary;\nlearning from and moving past the inevitable setbacks;\nreformulating the research problem when necessary;\nimplementing new methods in code (when applicable);\nchoosing appropriate experiments and metrics;\ncommunicating and reflecting on progress, setbacks, and results;\nthinking of future research directions.\n\n\nThe report should be submitted as a GitHub repository based on the template here. The template includes a LATEX style file that should be used for the report. (Detailed instructions for usage can be found in the repository’s README file.) Any experimental/numerical results should be reproducible. All code should be reusable, clearly commented/documented, and exist in the src/ folder of the same GitHub repository to which you give me access as a collaborator. Code can be in any language you wish, though my strong preference is for R or python."

    "section": "Course description",
    "text": "Course description\nLargely unnoticed by economists, over the last three decades statisticians and computer scientists have developed sophisticated prediction procedures and methods of model selection and forecast evaluation under the rubric of statistical learning theory. These methods have revolutionized pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, and the modern industry of data mining (without the pejorative connotation) would not exist without it.\nIn this short course, we will investigate the connections between modern statistical methodology and standard techniques which are more common in economics and social science. The goal is to develop an understanding for the circumstances under which different statistical methods are appropriate, how methods behave when the model for the data generating process is incorrect, and why some methods can adapt while others cannot. We will focus especially on selecting models with good predictive performance and on the relationships between model complexity, statistical estimation, and the amount of data used to estimate the model.\nThe starting point for statistical learning is the notion of predictive risk and the tradeoff between bias and variance. With this tradeoff in mind, we will investigate the importance of assessing models using training and test data, the benefits of regularization, and the necessity of selecting tuning parameters carefully. We will illustrate each of these issues with some standard econometric procedures applied to financial and economic datasets while at the same time, introducing some potentially new procedures which may be useful in your own research."

    "section": "Suggested preparation",
    "text": "Suggested preparation\nIn order to be best prepared for this course, we suggest that you brush up on your econometrics, especially the content about probability. Most useful will be to remind your self about expected values and variance, convergence in probability and consistency, maximum likelihood, ordinary least squares and some time series topics like autoregressive models. Also, remind yourself what a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is (you probably know more about this than we do, but perhaps not). Less useful are GMM techniques and cointegration.\nBefore coming to class, we suggest that you take a look at the first three (3) chapters of Cosma Shalizi’s preprint Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View. These chapters will serve as a nice introduction to the materials we intend to cover. The rest of the book is great too if you are feeling more ambitious/motivated."

We will try to make all of our code available on the website so that you may experiment with it. The software is available for free on CRAN. An official introduction is available there, and many other introductions are available on the web. See for example here. Feel free to download and play around with R, but experience and/or mastery of computer programming is not necessary."

    "text": "Daniel is Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Before moving North, he spent 8 years on the faculty at Indiana University, Bloomington. His research interests involve the estimation and quantification of prediction risk, especially developing methods for evaluating the predictive abilities of complex dependent data. This includes the application of statistical learning techniques to time series prediction problems, as well as investigations of cross-validation and the bootstrap for risk estimation.\nDaniel did his undergraduate studies at Indiana University where he received a Bachelor of Science in Music with a concentration in cello performance from the Jacobs School of Music and a Bachelor of Arts in economics and mathematics. Prior to graduate school, he worked as a Research Associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in Statistics where he was named graduate student of the year for 2012 and received the Umesh Gavasakar Memorial Thesis Award for his dissertation “Generalization Error Bounds for State Space Models.” In 2017, he was a recipient of the Indiana University Trustees Teaching Award. In 2018, he received an NSF CAREER award. His work has also been supported by grants from the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of Daniel’s applied work has focused on methods for understanding and modelling epidemiological data. He is a core member of the BC COVID-19 Modelling Group and works on research, forecasting, nowcasting, and software development with Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Research Group."
