## Applying to UBC Statistics or MDS Programs 

I generally have no special powers when it comes to being admitted to MSc/PhD or MDS programs. At UBC, students are admitted to the department before choosing an advisor later in their program. If you are interested, I encourage you to consult the [department website](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate).

If you want to learn more, your best bet is to email the [Graduate Admissions Officer](mailto:admiss@stat.ubc.ca).

## Requesting letters of recommendation 

I frequently get requests for letters of recommendation, and I'm generally happy
to comply. However, unless we regularly interacted, it is unlikely that I can
provide useful information to a recruiter or admissions committee member. In 
these cases, I **highly** recommend asking someone else who can provide more detailed descriptions of your unique strengths. 

If you are currently enrolled in class with me, and you would like a letter, I 
will ask that you attend office hours, ask questions, of in another way give me
some information about yourself. Without such interaction, I will likely write a
generic "this student took a class with me" letter, but experience suggests that
this type of letter is not likely to help you to be admitted to graduate school.

In order for me to write, I will need at least **two** weeks notice before the
first deadline. 

-   A list of all positions to which you are applying along with deadlines for
each.
-   A recent CV or resume that includes a list of courses taken in your major 
and an unofficial transcript.
-   A personal statement (likely the one you're sending in one of the
applications).
-   A description of any notable interactions we've had that I should highlight.
This means personal interactions, not a description of the material you liked
in my course.
-   If you have a preferred name as well as a given name, please list both. I 
I need to be able to connect your email to your application and potentially to
your Canvas profile.
