Daniel is Professor of Statistics at the University of British 
Columbia in Vancouver. Before moving North, he spent 8 years on the faculty at 
Indiana University, Bloomington. His research interests involve the estimation 
and quantification of prediction risk, especially developing methods for 
evaluating the predictive abilities of complex dependent data. This includes 
the application of statistical learning techniques to time series prediction 
problems, as well as investigations of cross-validation and the bootstrap for 
risk estimation.

Daniel did his undergraduate studies at Indiana University where he received a 
Bachelor of Science in Music with a concentration in cello performance from the 
Jacobs School of Music and a Bachelor of Arts in economics and mathematics. 
Prior to graduate school, he worked as a Research Associate at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University
in Statistics where he was named graduate student of the year for 2012 and 
received the Umesh Gavasakar Memorial Thesis Award for his dissertation 
"Generalization Error Bounds for State Space Models." In 2017, he was a 
recipient of the Indiana University Trustees Teaching Award. In 2018, he 
received an NSF CAREER award. His work has also been supported by grants from 
the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Canadian Statistical Sciences 
Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and the National Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council of Canada. 

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of Daniel's applied work has 
focused on methods for understanding and modelling epidemiological data. He was 
a core member of the [BC COVID-19 Modelling Group](https://bccovid-19group.ca) 
and works on research, forecasting, nowcasting, and software development with 
Carnegie Mellon University's [Delphi Research Group](https://delphi.cmu.edu).
