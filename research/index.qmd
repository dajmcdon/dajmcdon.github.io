title: "Research"
---

My research sits at the intersection of statistical theory and computer science
methodology and is part of the modern ascendancy of mining "big data" to produce 
fundamentally novel science from complicated datasets. Specifically, I seek to 
illuminate the role played by the nature and quantity of regularization as a 
tool for improved scientific understanding.

Through this lens, my research can be divided into four intersecting areas: (1) 
computational approximation methodology, (2) model selection, (3) high-dimensional
and nonparametric theory, and (4) applications related to these. My work explores
and exploits the connections between these areas rather than approaching them 
separately---my contributions have been developed out of the pressing need to 
justify methodology as implemented in applications rather than in a vacuum 
devoid of empirical motivation. My research program seeks to generate statistical
guarantees for the procedures that applied researchers use while also developing 
methodology for complicated, high-dimensional problems. Within this context, 
much of my work involves what is referred to as regularization---the process of 
mathematically balancing complex but meaningful scientific models with a 
preference for simple fundamental structures.
