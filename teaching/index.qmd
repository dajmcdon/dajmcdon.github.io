## Philosophy

My primary educational goal is to enhance statistical literacy and communication among my students. To me, statistical literacy means combining careful data analysis with scientific expertise to grapple with problems. Given the quantity of data available today, I want my students to learn how to engage in the type of quantitative reasoning and decision making necessary for understanding applications in the sciences, business, and public policy.

Going beyond the didacticism of basic statistical literacy, I strive to inform students about the fundamental role statistics and computation plays in the comprehension of real-world phenomena across disciplines and to motivate them to use this knowledge in their daily lives. Finally, I endeavour to cultivate curiosity in my students and to create an open and nurturing learning environment.
