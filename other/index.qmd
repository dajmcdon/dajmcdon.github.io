## R packages for recent papers and publications

(See [github/dajmcdon](http://github.com/dajmcdon) or my
  [publications page](/research/all-pubs.html) for others)
  
* [`{fkf}`](https://waternumbers.github.io/FKF/index.html): __Fast Kalman Filter.__
  Very fast Kalman filtering and smoothing. 
* [`{sparsegl}`](https://dajmcdon.github.io/sparsegl/) __Sparse Group Lasso.__
    Efficient implementation of sparse group lasso with optional bound constraints
    on the coefficients. It supports the use of a sparse design matrix as well 
    as returning coefficient estimates in a sparse matrix. Furthermore, it 
    correctly calculates the degrees of freedom to allow for information criteria
    rather than cross-validation with very large data. Finally, the interface to
    compiled code avoids unnecessary copies and allows for the use of long integers.
* [`{rtestim}`](https://dajmcdon.github.io/rtestim) __Estimate the Effective__ 
    __Reproductive Number with Trend Filtering.__ The instantaneous reproduction
    number, $R_t$, roughly says "how
    many new infections will result from each new infection today".
    Values larger than 1 indicate that an epidemic is growing while those
    less than 1 indicate decline.  This package uses Poisson likelihood and a 
    trend filtering penalty (a type of regularized 
    nonparametric regression), to impose smoothness in the estimate.
* [`{dpf}`](http://github.com/dajmcdon/dpf): __Discrete particle__
  __filtering.__ This package greedily estimates switching Kalman filters
  *fast*. Also useful for analysis of musical tempos.
* [`{AIMER}`](http://github.com/dajmcdon/aimer): __Amplified, Initially Marginal, Eigenvector Regression.__ As described in Ding, L. and McDonald, D.J.,
"Predicting phenotypes from microarrays using amplified, initially
marginal, eigenvector regression". A better version of supervised
principal components analysis.
* [`{cplr}`](http://github.com/dajmcdon/cplr): __Compressed penalized linear regression.__ As described in Homrighausen, D. and McDonald, D.J.,
"Compressed and penalized linear regression."

### Resources for R and basic analysis

(see also my course materials on the [Teaching](/teaching/) page)

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), a nice textbook from Hadley Wickham
* [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com), good exposition on setting up and combining R and Git
* [Basic text mining in R](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/265713_cbef910aee7642dc8b62996e38d2825d.html)
* [Fix common Github+R issues](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#rpostback-askpass-error), the dreaded rpostback askpass error
* [The batchtools package](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/index.html) for easy cluster parallelization

## Artwork and other attributions

The artwork throughout this website is generated using R and additional packages.
In principle, it will change randomly whenever the site is updated. Some of 
these use the [`{aRtsy}`](https://koenderks.github.io/aRtsy/index.html) package 
built by Koen Derks. Others use some custom functions that I occasionally work 
on in my spare time. These have benefited from reading Danielle Navarro's 
excellent [blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/#category=Art) and other material, 
as well as some posts by [Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields). 

This website was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) along with some custom 
CSS inspired by the [Hugo Ap√©ro](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/contributors/) 
theme. Building the site in Quarto removes some flexibility that I used to have 
with my old Jekyll site, but it also allows for much easier integration of R code. 

If any of this seems useful, see the underlying [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dajmcdon/dajmcdon.github.io)
for the code. There are script files that control the artwork as well as 
autogenerating the list of publications (a massive headache in other static 
site generators).

## Personal

I still play cello occasionally, both privately and with the 
[Vancouver Philharmonic](https://www.vanphil.ca). And I enjoy listening to 
classical music whenever I get the chance. I've only once successfully 
connected [research and music](/chopin-2022-slides), but this leaves music to 
be a nice hobby, a total diversion from academic work.

I should also point to my partner's website: 
[Tamara Mitchell](https://tamaraleemitchell.github.io). She does great
work in Hispanic literature, and we're lucky to be at the same institution. We 
also have three(!!) wonderful cats that we spoil rotten.
