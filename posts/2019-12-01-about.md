excerpt: Being a professor means doling out a lot of advice.

 I decided to start this blog when a couple of students asked for advice and resources related to writing the dissertation and preparing for the job market. Every so often, I convert the advice provided in emails and conversations into blog posts that others might find--and maybe even find useful. As with much advice, take what works for you and ignore what doesn't. And for any graduate students stopping by, always listen to your advisor over some random person on the internet. Sporadically, I write up other thoughts related to life as an academic, such as pedagogy, book reviews, academic activism, etc. Regardless of what brought you here, thanks for visiting.
